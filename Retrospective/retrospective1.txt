Positives:
- The project is going well. We spent a good amount of time on it and made a MVP
- Scrum board is on point
- Stay on task during meetings
- It was good that we did the extra exercises for our sprint review
- Did outside stuff when we needed it



Improvements:
- Have meetings where we sit together and do work in the same place, so we can help each other
- Do more outside coding to get more practice on difficult concepts
- Outline and talk through meetings (start concept meeting as we go along the sprint)
- Set hard deadlines for things
- Try pair-programming
